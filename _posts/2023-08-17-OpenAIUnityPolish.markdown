Following the previous post, I wanted to create a somewhat polished experience to display the OpenAI texturing. Building on the space/scifi theme that was in the previous demos, there was a lot of creative room for building small animations and a small scene.

## Polishing UI

Using a couple of UI elements drawn out by a friend, I was able to create a "computer screen" that would hold the audio input options as well as display the image that was used in the texturing on the left.

## Learning Sound

To make the experience as immersive as possible, I also decided to play around with Unity's audio source system. The 3D sound settings are super useful and can be used to determine when sounds start to fall off. This is especially useful when I want to use audio to help portray the distance of drones and ships in my scene.

## Demo Video

With everything said, here is the demo for the polished experience:

## Final Notes

The demo video is a good preview of what the experience is like. However, I feel that being inside the VR headset gives an extra level of depth that pulls everything together. From having a mini screen on your arm to seeing the spaceship fly away with the texture you made, this was a really fun project to work on.
