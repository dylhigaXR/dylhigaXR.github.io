Having created a multitude of mini-projects and small-scale experiences, I realized I had never published and listed my projects on a store. To be fair, a lot of my projects had the polish level of a proof of concept and I would never feel goood about publishing a game that had bugs in it. However, over the last 2 months I worked on a, still small, but much more polished VR game!

# Some Thoughts
This time, a lot of thought went into aspects such as UI and player experience. I ensured that the gameplay was understandable and that the player had access to things such as a pause menu and tutorial. Additionally, I spent a considerable amount of time learning how to use Scriptable Objects and how to properly organize code. I feel like this was a big learning experience for me, and I emerged as a much better Unity Developer.
