My name is Dylan Higashionna and I am a recent graduate from UC Santa Cruz. I studied Computer Science: Game Design which lead me to become interested in XR and its potential integration with gaming.

Here you will find my projects that I do on the side!

I think that XR has a lot to offer and I find that making games/experiences for it to be something that is unexplored and exciting.
